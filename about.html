                    <p class="mono"><!--Hey there! I'm Om Wani a.k.a. PotatoChips,
                        a computer science student with a huge passion for all things tech. I love Linux. I prefer using Either Debian or Linux Mint.
                        
                        Aside from my love for Linux, I want to be a game developer. Games have always been a huge part of my life, and I believe they have the power to create immersive experiences and bring joy to people worldwide.
                        I want to have more games running natively on Linux OS.
                        
                        Coming back to contributing to Linux,
                        I started participating in National Science Exhibition at GMRT in 2019, where we tried to reach young kids, adults as well as seniors and promote open source.
                        I also conducted some workshops and talks at my college regarding promoting open source to fellow students of my college.
                        Other than Linux, games, etc. I like new tech.-->

                        Hey there! I'm Om Wani a.k.a. PotatoChips,<br> a computer science student who absolutely adores everything tech-related. Linux, especially Debian, is my OS of choice - I just can't get enough of it!
                        <br><br>Apart from my Linux love, I've set my sights on becoming a game developer. Games have always been a significant part of my life, and I believe they have the power to create immersive experiences and bring joy to people worldwide.
                        <br><br>What makes my journey unique is my focus on exploring game development from the perspective of open source. I'm eager to find ways to make game development more inclusive and collaborative within the open-source community. Sharing knowledge and working together can lead to incredible games and foster a strong gaming community.
                        <br><br>When I'm not diving into game development or tinkering with Linux, I'm on the lookout for the latest tech trends. I have an insatiable curiosity for trying out new gadgets, playing around with code, and staying ahead of the game in the tech world.
                        <br><br>My dream is to make a positive impact in the tech industry by combining my passion for game development with the power of open source. Join me on this exciting journey as we explore the boundless possibilities of game development through the lens of open source!
